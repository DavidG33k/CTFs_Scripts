# CTFs scripts collection
Open source collection of scripts to solve CTFs of every platform 👨🏻‍💻.

## Rules
- Just use the typer library to pass all required arguments to your scripts.

## Optional
- Why not, you can use Rich library to elevate your script to a superior level 😉.

## Steps
- Create a new folder of the vulnerability category, if not already exists.
- Than, in case of multiple files, create a new folder with the name of the CTF and upload all files end required folder in this new directory. Else you can put your script file directly to the main category folder.
- Import your folder and the main.py file in the root and add a new ***@app.command*** typer with a short description about the CTF and the platform.
